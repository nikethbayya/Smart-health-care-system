A Smart Health prediction system can transform the way people take charge of their health 
while also connecting them to the nearest healthcare providers immediately. Many timeâ€™s 
patients are unable to access healthcare services frequently due to some reason or the other. 
The smart health prediction system seeks to solve this problem by enabling patients to get 
instance healthcare advice and guidance online from licensed medical data. 
The smart health prediction application is an online consultation system for users. The system 
is fed with huge volumes of healthcare data (fitness and body requirement or health issues 
associated with those symptoms). So, when a user enters their medical problems and his data 
like height, weight and other details through fitness watches or sensors the application uses 
data mining to delves into the database and find the most accurate match of 
irregularity/abnormalities related to those symptoms.
Furthermore, the app also provides the contact information of various medical specialists and 
practitioners with whom the patients can easily connect via the platform.
